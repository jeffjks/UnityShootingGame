The prefabs in this folder are intended to be used with my other spaceships, e.g. Berlin Class 
Battlecruiser or Hindenburg Class Battleship.

These capital ships are ca. 2 unity units big. The prefabs of the Litzmann Class Gun Carrier in this 
prefab folder are therefore smaller than one unity unit.

If you want to rescale the capital and frigate sized ships you can use the same rescale factor for
all ships.


If you want to use the gun carrier separately you should use the prefabs in the folder: 

			"PrefabsUnityDimensions"

The prefabs in the above mentioned folder are scaled bigger so that a gun carrier is two unity units big.
