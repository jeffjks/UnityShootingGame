The prefabs in this folder are intended to be used as stand alone models. they are scaled to unity 
dimensions and are at least one unity unit big.



If you want to use the frigates together with my other spaceships like "Berlin Class Battlecruiser" or
"Hindenburg Class Battleship" you should use the prefabs in the folder: 

					"Prefabs"

The prefabs in the above mentioned folder are scaled smaller so that the frigate sized sips are
in relation to the capital ships.
